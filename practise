Exactly. You’ve just hit on the "Holy Grail" of recruitment tech.
If you build a tool that can import a messy CV, clean it up, and export it into your ATS-perfect template, you aren't just a "CV Maker" anymore—you are a Data Processor.
Here is how that "Undeniable" workflow looks:
 * The Choice: The candidate lands on the company site. They see two buttons:
   * [ Upload My Current CV ]
   * [ I don't have a CV / Build from Scratch ]
 * The "Magic" Import: If they upload a messy CV, your code "reads" it (this is called Parsing). It pulls out the name, the jobs, and the dates, and automatically fills in the boxes in your builder.
 * The Optimization: The candidate sees their old info inside your clean interface. They can then use your "Power Verbs" or "AI Summary" buttons to make it better.
 * The Result: The company gets a high-quality, readable PDF and structured data, and the candidate gets a professional upgrade.
Why this is a "Better" way:
 * Recruiters love it: They hate messy CVs. If you promise them that every CV coming through your system will look exactly like your "Executive" template, you save them hours of eye strain.
 * Candidates love it: They don't have to type everything from scratch if they already have an old document.
Can your current code do this?
Right now, your code is great at generating a CV from input. To do what you just described, you need to add a "Parser"—a piece of code that can read a PDF/Word doc and turn it into text.
Since you are using JavaScript, you can use a library like pdf.js or an API to "scrape" the text out of an uploaded file and map it to your variables like fullName, jobTitle, and experienceList.
Which Organizations to approach?
Focus on South African Recruitment Agencies (since your code mentioned ZAR/South Africa) or Large Retailers (like Shoprite, Pick n Pay, or Pep).
Why? Because they get thousands of "messy" CVs daily. If you tell them, "I can turn every single messy upload into a perfectly formatted, ATS-friendly document before it even hits your email," they will listen.
Your Technical To-Do List:
 * Add an Upload Input: Create a section where users can drop an old PDF.
 * Add a Parsing Script: Use a tool to extract text from that PDF.
 * Map the Data: Write a function that looks for keywords (like "Experience" or "Education") in that text and puts it into your existing form.
Would you like me to show you a basic Javascript example of how to start "reading" text from an uploaded file so you can auto-fill your form?
