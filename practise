=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.    
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,    

i  Using project quickcv-47c99 (QuickCV) .

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you   
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.  

✔ What do you want to use as your public directory? .
✔ Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? No    
✔ Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? No
