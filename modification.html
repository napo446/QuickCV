This is the Master Global Enterprise Blueprint for QuickCV. It is meticulously designed to be printed as an official operational manual for CEOs, HR Directors, and Board Members of multi-national corporations like Fidelity. It establishes a clear, unbreakable hierarchy: the Super Admin as the Strategic Owner and the Normal Admin as the Tactical Producer.
QuickCV: The Global Enterprise Recruitment Ecosystem
I. THE COMMERCIAL ARCHITECTURE (The Global Rate Card)
The financial engine of QuickCV is built on a "Base + Overage" model, ensuring that the Super Admin (The Owner) only pays for actual value while maintaining a predictable budget.
1. Volume-Based Intelligence Pricing
The more the system scales, the more cost-effective it becomes for the organization.
| Volume Tier (Monthly CVs) | Unit Rate (Per CV) | Monthly Budgetary Base |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 1,000 | R6.50 | R6,500 (Maximum) |
| 1,001 – 10,000 | R4.50 | R45,000 (Maximum) |
| 10,001 – 50,000 | R2.50 | R125,000 (Maximum) |
| 50,000+ (Enterprise) | R1.00 | R125,000 Base + R1/Extra CV |
2. Infrastructure & Licensing Fees
 * Monthly Super Admin Portal Fee: R14,500. This covers the "Command Center" global reporting, POPIA-compliant data hosting, and enterprise-grade security.
 * Normal Admin Seat Price: R2,500 per account per month. Each seat is a dedicated workspace for a recruiter.
 * The Device Integrity Lock: Every account is hard-locked to one device. If a user attempts to log in on a second device (Tablet B), the original session on Laptop A is instantly terminated. This protects corporate data and ensures license compliance.
II. THE SUPER ADMIN PORTAL (The Command & Control)
The Super Admin is the sole financial and legal authority of the system. This portal is designed for high-level oversight and strategic resource allocation.
1. Financial Sovereignty & Wallet Management
 * The Master Bucket: Only the Super Admin can view the "Credit Ledger" and monitor the "Fuel Gauge" of remaining CV credits.
 * Payment Authority: All "Top-Up" authorizations and overage approvals must come from this portal. Normal Admins have zero visibility into financial data.
 * ROI Analytics: Generates reports comparing QuickCV costs against traditional agency spend, showing immediate corporate savings.
2. Personnel & Security Oversight (The "Kill Switch")
 * Account Provisioning: The Super Admin creates and manages the Normal Admin accounts (Seats).
 * Access Revocation: If an employee leaves the company, the Super Admin can instantly revoke access, killing the device session and protecting the candidate database.
 * POPIA Audit Logs: Provides a massive, uneditable record of every action taken by every employee—essential for global data compliance and legal defense.
3. National Task Distribution (The "Dealer")
 * Centralized Intake: All applications from national campaigns hit the Super Admin's "Holding Tank" first.
 * Load Balancing: The Super Admin "deals the cards," pushing specific volumes (e.g., 1,000 CVs) to specific Normal Admins based on their branch or performance.
 * Queue Management: Allows the Boss to reroute work if one branch is overwhelmed, ensuring 100% operational efficiency.
III. THE NORMAL ADMIN PORTAL (The Tactical Engine)
The Normal Admin is the high-efficiency employee. Their portal is a "focused environment" designed solely for high-speed vetting and hiring.
1. Job Architecture & Instant Deployment
 * Job DNA: Admins enter the specific requirements, salary, and GPS location for a role.
 * The Auto-Sieve: Admins set "Knock-out Questions" (e.g., "Do you have a valid PSIRA license?"). The system automatically moves failures to a Red (Rejected) folder.
 * AI Scoring: The portal reads every CV and assigns a match score from 1 to 100 based on the job requirements.
2. Candidate Pipeline Execution
 * Status Shifting: Recruiters drag candidates from "Applied" to "Shortlisted" to "Hired" in a visual pipeline.
 * Mass Communication: Recruiters can reject 500 unqualified candidates in one click, sending personalized, professional notifications instantly.
 * Interview Scheduling: Integrated calendars allow candidates to book their own interview slots, removing the "phone tag" delay.
3. Internal Intelligence
 * Note Logging: Recruiter feedback is logged on a permanent timeline for every candidate.
 * Stats Reporting: Normal Admins see their own daily vetting counts, while the Super Admin monitors these stats to track productivity.
IV. THE GLOBAL OPERATIONAL SYNC (Step-by-Step)
 * PHASE A (The Investment): The Super Admin pays the R14,500 License Fee and buys a 50k CV bundle (R125,000). They then create the 5 Normal Admin seats (R2,500 each).
 * PHASE B (The Launch): The Super Admin generates a national link and advertises it.
 * PHASE C (The Intake): Candidates flood the "Holding Tank." The Super Admin watches the count hit 10,000+ in real-time.
 * PHASE D (The Distribution): The Super Admin splits the 10,000 CVs—sending 2,000 to each of the 5 Normal Admin recruiters.
 * PHASE E (The Execution): Normal Admins log in on their locked devices and use AI to find the top 1% of talent in minutes.
 * PHASE F (The Audit): The Super Admin pulls the final reports, pays any overages at R1.00 per CV, and integrates the hires into payroll.
V. FINAL SUMMARY: THE QUICKCV PHILOSOPHY
QuickCV is more than software; it is a Corporate Governance System. By separating the Super Admin (Owner) from the Normal Admin (Worker), the system creates a watertight financial and security hierarchy. The "One Device" rule ensures that every R2,500 seat is protected, and the "Holding Tank" distribution model ensures the Boss is always in control of the workload. This is how the world's largest companies turn the chaos of 1,000,000 applications into a streamlined, profitable, and secure hiring machine.
Would you like me to convert this entire blueprint into a formal "Enterprise Service Agreement" for you to present to your first big client?







This is the "Enterprise Access" model. You have shifted the power dynamic: the Boss is now pre-funding their talent search. This is a massive business win because you get the cash before the work even starts.
In SaaS terms, this is called a Pre-Paid Intake Quota. If the Boss hasn't paid, the "gates" are closed.
Here is the professional rewrite of your system’s operational flow, removing all "blocked" language and replacing it with "Quota Management" and "Active Sourcing" terminology.
I. The "Active Sourcing" Logic (The Boss's First Step)
Before any candidate can even see an upload button, the Boss must initiate the system.
 * The Activation: In the admin-portal.html, the Boss sets a Capture Limit (e.g., "I want to receive 50 CVs").
 * The Payment (No Charity): The system calculates the cost based on the Tier (Basic vs. Intelligence). The Boss pays upfront to "open the gate."
 * Gate Logic: Only after a successful transaction does the professional-cv.html link become "Active." If the Boss hasn't paid, the applicant sees a message: "This talent intake is currently closed."
II. The Candidate Workflow (Automated Data Mapping)
Once the gate is open, the process for the applicant is seamless:
 * The Messy-to-Clean Upload: The user uploads their messy file. The system automatically extracts their data and populates the required fields.
 * Smart Suggestions: The system suggests missing info (optional) to improve their match score.
 * Submission: The user hits "Done." This is free for the user, but it consumes 1 unit of the Boss's pre-paid quota.
 * Timestamp Priority: Every submission is marked with a precise date and time. This ensures a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) queue.
III. The Employer Talent Dashboard (admin-portal.html)
The Boss now sees the results of their investment.
 * The Queue: CVs appear in order from 1 to [Paid Number].
 * High-Level Metadata: The Boss can see the candidate’s name, the region (e.g., Soshanguve), and the exact time they applied.
 * The Tools: Because the Boss has already paid, the View and Download buttons are fully functional.
 * The Clean Conversion: When the Boss clicks "View," they don't see the "messy" file; they see the converted, professional digital profile your system created.
The Professional Breakdown (Point Form)
1. Pre-Paid Intake Model
 * Model: Boss pays for a specific volume of applicants upfront.
 * Rate: R20 (Basic) or R100 (Intelligence) per slot.
 * Benefit: You have the money in your bank account before a single candidate even visits the site.
2. Tiered Intelligence
 * Basic Intake: The first 50 people who apply are the 50 the Boss sees.
 * Intelligence Intake: The Boss pays more (R100 per slot), and your system uses your Intellect Logic to ensure those 50 slots are filled by the Highest Qualified people, not just the fastest.
3. Queue Management
 * Automatic Shutoff: If the Boss paid for 50 CVs, the 51st person cannot submit. The system automatically stops accepting data once the quota is reached.
 * SaaS Language: "Your Talent Pipeline has reached its pre-paid capacity. Upgrade your quota to receive more applicants."
Why this is a "Serious Business" Move:
 * Zero Overhead Risk: You only process data that has already been paid for. You are never "guessing" if you'll make a profit.
 * Professional Scarcity: By setting a limit, you tell the Boss that talent is a valuable resource. If they want 100 people, they pay for 100 people.
 * Efficiency: You aren't "blocking" the admin; you are empowering them. They paid for 50, so you are delivering the exact 50 they asked for, cleaned and ready for review.
The "SaaS" Pitch to the Boss:
> "Our system operates on a Pre-Paid Talent Acquisition model. You define your intake volume and region, and we activate our Messy-to-Clean Conversion Engine for that specific quota. This ensures you only pay for the exact amount of talent your team has the capacity to review, with every profile delivered in a standardized, professional format."
> 
Would you like me to show you the simple Firebase logic to "decrement" (reduce) the Boss's paid quota every time an applicant hits the 'Send' button?














This is the Architectural Blueprint for a high-tier SaaS recruitment platform. It is designed to maximize your profit, minimize your server costs, and provide undeniable value to a corporate "Boss" who is tired of wasting time.
​Executive Summary: The "Logic over Labor" Model
​The platform operates as a high-volume data-handling engine. It eliminates the manual "sifting" phase of recruitment by categorizing applicants into two distinct value streams: Raw Pipeline (Basic) and Calculated Insights (Intelligence). By charging per applicant, the business remains profitable regardless of whether the employer makes a hire, turning every job post into a guaranteed revenue event.
​I. Tier 1: The Basic Tier (The "Digital Filing Cabinet")
​Strategic Positioning: This is for the budget-conscious manager or high-volume roles (cleaners, drivers, general labor) where quantity is the priority.
​Pricing: R20.00 per applicant.
​Workflow:
​Candidates upload their CVs via a simplified mobile-friendly portal.
​The system stores the file and captures basic contact metadata (Name, Email, Date).
​What the Boss Sees:
​A chronological list of applicants.
​Basic "Unprocessed" data.
​A "Download CV" button for every candidate.
​Why it’s not a charity:
​Labor Transfer: The Boss is paying less because they are doing the work of reading the CVs.
​High Margin: Your backend costs are essentially just file storage. At R20/head, a 5,000-person applicant pool generates R100,000 in revenue with near-zero compute cost.
​II. Tier 2: The Intelligence Tier (The "Decision Engine")
​Strategic Positioning: This is the flagship product for "people who mean business." It is sold as a tool that replaces the need for a junior HR screener.  
​Pricing: R100.00 per applicant.
​Workflow:
​The system uses Structural Parsing (searching for dates and keywords) rather than expensive AI.
​It calculates "Facts" from the CV text.
​The "Intelligence" Revealed to the Boss:
​Experience Aggregator: "Candidate has 12 years of total experience across 4 companies."
​Education Counter: "Candidate holds 3 relevant certifications/degrees."
​Keyword Match Score: A percentage (e.g., 85%) based on how many of the Boss's "Must-Have" words appear in the CV.
​Stability Index: Calculates the average tenure (e.g., "Stays at jobs for an average of 4 years").
​What the Boss Sees:
​A Ranked Dashboard: The best candidates are pinned to the top based on their score.
​Metric Badges: Small icons next to names like [10+ Years Exp] or [Local Candidate].
​Why it’s not a charity:
​Outcome-Based Pricing: You are charging for the Time Saved.
​Intellect Tax: The Boss pays an extra R80 per person for the logic you built.
​Massive Revenue: A 2,000-person pool at this tier generates R200,000.
​III. System Logic: How the Backend Protects Your Wallet
​As a first-year student, you cannot afford "runaway" costs. The system is built for Scalability.
​Pre-Paid Infrastructure:
​The Boss must "Activate" a job post by buying an Applicant Pack (e.g., R5,000 for 250 Basic applicants).
​This ensures you are never in debt to Firebase. If the money isn't in the account, the job post goes offline.
​Zero-AI Overhead:
​By using text-parsing (RegEx) to find years and keywords, you avoid API fees.
​The "Intelligence" is just smart math, not expensive machine learning.
​Data Normalization:
​The system converts every messy PDF/Word doc into a standard "Data Object." This makes your database clean, fast, and searchable.






To implement this logic, we will structure the Employer Dashboard to reflect the clear distinction between the "Date-Priority" Basic Tier and the "Ranked-Segment" Intelligence Tier.
1. Basic Tier: The "First-Come-First-Served" Queue
In this tier, the system follows a strictly chronological order. This is ideal for high-volume hiring where speed of application is a primary metric.
 * Sorting Logic: Candidates are displayed from the earliest timestamp to the most recent.
 * Cost Structure: You charge based on the total number of applicants (e.g., R20 for the first 100).
 * Visual Display: A simple vertical list showing Name, Location, and Time Applied.
2. Intelligence Tier: The "Percentage-Segment" Ranking
The Intelligence Tier adds a layer of logic that categorizes candidates into "Quality Buckets". This allows the Boss to ignore the low-match candidates and focus only on the top tiers.
Your dashboard will group applicants into the following sections based on their AI-calculated match score:
| Match Percentage | Section Label | Strategic Value for the Boss |
|---|---|---|
| 100% – 80% | Elite Matches | Immediate interview candidates; high keyword and stability density. |
| 79% – 60% | Strong Contenders | Qualified backups; likely meet all "must-have" requirements. |
| 59% – 40% | Potential Fits | May require upskilling; some missing core competencies. |
| 39% – 20% | Low Alignment | Missing several key indicators or have low stability scores. |
| 19% – 0% | Non-Matches | High-risk applicants with little to no relevance to the mandate. |
3. Feature Differentiation (Basic vs. Intelligence)
To justify the Intel Tier subscription costs (e.g., R1,500 – R8,500/month), the Intelligence Tier must provide data that the Basic Tier cannot.
| Feature | Basic Tier (R20/Applicant) | Intelligence Tier (Intel Subscription) |
|---|---|---|
| Applicant List | Chronological (By Date) | Categorized (By Match %) |
| Stability Index | Not Available | Average tenure calculation per candidate |
| Keyword Parsing | Basic search | Deep semantic matching of skills |
| Career Progression | Not Available | Tracks seniority growth over time |
| Priority Support | Standard | Dedicated account management |
4. How the "Intelligence Charge" Works
The Boss pays the standard "Per Applicant" rate to open the intake gate. The Intelligence Tier fee is then charged as an additional "service fee" for the computing power required to segment the candidates into the percentage buckets you described.
Would you like me to write the JavaScript logic that sorts your Firebase applicants into these five percentage-based "Section Buckets"?
