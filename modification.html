BIG PICTURE (ONE SYSTEM, TWO USERS)

You are building one CV engine with two entry points:

Job Seeker Portal
→ A person uploads their CV themselves

Admin Portal (CV brought in physically)
→ An admin uploads the CV on behalf of a job seeker

Behind the scenes, the exact same CV processing engine runs.

No AI.
No guessing.
Just rules, patterns, and validation.

CORE IDEA (VERY IMPORTANT)

Your system does NOT care about layout or design.

It only cares about:

Text

Headings

Common CV patterns

So whether the CV is:

One page

Two columns

Creative

Traditional

With icons or graphics

👉 The system ignores layout and extracts text only.

STEP 1: CV UPLOAD (ANY FORMAT)
Supported files:

PDF

DOCX

TXT (optional)

What happens immediately:

File is uploaded

System converts it to raw text

PDF → text

DOCX → text

Layout, fonts, colours are discarded

At this point:
You now have plain text, like a long document.

STEP 2: TEXT SCANNING (NO AI, ONLY RULES)

This is where the magic happens — but it’s not AI.

The system uses:

Keyword detection

Regular expressions (regex)

Section rules

Example: Name Detection

The system looks for patterns like:

First line with 2–3 words

Capitalised words

No numbers

If found → fills Name field

Example: Email Detection

Uses regex:

something@something.com


✔ Guaranteed accuracy
✔ No AI needed

Example: Phone Number

Looks for:

Country codes

10–13 digits

Spaces or dashes allowed

Example: Section Headings

The system scans for known headings like:

EDUCATION

WORK EXPERIENCE

SKILLS

PROFILE

SUMMARY

PROJECTS

Even if written as:

“Employment History”

“Professional Experience”

You define these in advance.

STEP 3: CARD MAPPING (THIS IS KEY)

Once data is detected, it is placed into fixed “CV cards”.

Example Cards:

Personal Details Card

Education Card

Experience Card

Skills Card

Each card has:

Required fields

Optional fields

Validation rules

Example:

If the system finds:

University of Cape Town
BSc Computer Science
2021 – 2024


It fills:

Institution ✔

Qualification ✔

Dates ✔

STEP 4: MISSING DATA DETECTION (NO AI)

If a card is incomplete, the system:

Marks it as INCOMPLETE

Highlights missing fields

Shows predefined hints

Example:

Missing:

Date of birth

System message:

“Date of birth not found.
Please enter it in format: DD/MM/YYYY”

Hints are static and pre-written.

STEP 5: USER MANUAL COMPLETION

Now the user steps in.

Job Seeker:

Sees highlighted missing fields

Fills them in manually

Cannot submit until required fields are complete

Admin (CV brought in physically):

Uploads CV

Reviews extracted data

Asks candidate missing info OR fills it in

Same system.
Different user.

STEP 6: VALIDATION (RULES ONLY)

Before saving:

Email format checked

Phone number length checked

Dates checked

Required fields enforced

No guessing.
Either valid or rejected.

HOW THIS FITS BOTH PORTALS
1️⃣ JOB SEEKER PORTAL FLOW

Job seeker creates account

Uploads CV

System extracts info

Cards auto-filled

Missing fields highlighted

User completes them

CV saved in standard format

Ready for applications

Result:
Every CV now looks structured internally — even if uploaded messy.

2️⃣ NORMAL ADMIN PORTAL FLOW (IN-PERSON CV)

Candidate walks in with CV

Admin uploads CV

System extracts info

Admin reviews cards

Missing info flagged

Admin:

Edits immediately OR

Marks “Awaiting Candidate Info”

CV stored under organisation

Result:
Paper CVs become digital, searchable, and clean.

3️⃣ SUPER ADMIN PORTAL ROLE (FROM BEFORE)

This is where your previous portal design fits perfectly.

Super Admin can:

Define required fields per organisation

Define card structure

Define validation rules

See extraction success rates

See how many CVs required manual input

Monitor admin performance

Example metric:

“30% of CVs missing phone numbers”









SUPER ADMIN PORTAL — SIMPLE, POWERFUL, IN CONTROL
What This Portal Is (In Plain English)

The Super Admin Portal is where the boss stays in control.

It answers three questions instantly:

Who is doing what?

How much are we spending?

Is anything going wrong?

No clutter. No technical overload. Just clear visibility and simple actions.

1. User & Access Control (Who Can Do What)
Create & Manage Admins

Add or remove Normal Admins in one click

Turn access ON or OFF instantly

Each Admin uses one device only (no sharing, no misuse)

Emergency Stop (Kill Switch)

Instantly log out any Admin

Use if:

Someone leaves the company

Suspicious behaviour is detected

A mistake needs to be stopped immediately

Why bosses like this:
👉 Total control, no drama, no delays.

2. Work Distribution (Who Handles Which CVs)
Central CV Inbox

All applications arrive in one place

Nothing is lost, duplicated, or ignored

Simple Assignment

Assign CVs manually or

Let the system auto-assign evenly to Admins

Workload Balance

See who is overloaded and who is free

Move work with drag-and-drop simplicity

Why bosses like this:
👉 Faster hiring, no bottlenecks, no excuses.

3. Money & Usage Control (What Are We Spending?)
Credit Balance Dashboard

See:

Total CV credits bought

Credits used

Credits remaining

Low Balance Alerts

Warnings before credits run out

No surprise costs

Approval for Extra Spend

Only the Super Admin can approve extra usage

Every approval is recorded

Why bosses like this:
👉 Spending stays predictable and under control.

4. Performance Overview (Is the Team Doing Their Job?)
Admin Performance Snapshot

At a glance, see:

CVs processed per Admin

Speed of processing

Quality score (AI match strength)

Simple Rankings

Top performers

Underperformers

No complex reports — just clear indicators

Why bosses like this:
👉 Easy accountability without micromanagement.

5. Hiring Progress Visibility (What’s Happening Right Now?)
Live Hiring Status

How many CVs received today

How many reviewed

How many shortlisted

How many rejected or pending

Delay Alerts

See if applications are stuck too long

Step in only when needed

Why bosses like this:
👉 No blind spots. No “I didn’t know”.

6. Candidate & Communication Oversight
Message Control

Admins send messages as usual

Super Admin can:

Review templates

Ensure professional tone

Prevent mistakes or legal risks

Interview Scheduling View

See:

Interviews scheduled

No-shows

Response delays

Why bosses like this:
👉 Brand reputation stays protected.

7. Security & Data Safety (Quietly Working in the Background)

(No technical jargon shown to the boss — just reassurance)

Secure login

One user = one device

Full activity history (who did what and when)

Data protected and legally compliant

Why bosses like this:
👉 Peace of mind without needing to understand tech.

8. Simple Reports (For Decisions, Not Homework)
One-Click Reports

Hiring summary

Cost per hire

Admin productivity

Monthly or campaign-based

Export When Needed

Board meetings

Finance

Audits

Why bosses like this:
👉 Answers ready when questions are asked.

What Makes This Boss-Friendly

✔ Simple screens
✔ Clear numbers
✔ No unnecessary settings
✔ Control without complexity
✔ Works for small teams and large organisations











NORMAL ADMIN PORTAL — SIMPLE EXECUTION WORKSPACE
What This Portal Is (Plain Language)

The Normal Admin Portal is where work gets done.

Admins do three things only:

Review CVs

Communicate with candidates

Move candidates through hiring steps

They do not manage money, system rules, or data ownership.
Those stay with the Super Admin.

1. Login & Access (Simple, Controlled)
Secure Login

One account

One device

No sharing

If access is removed by Super Admin:

The Admin is logged out immediately

They cannot log back in

Why this works:
Admins feel trusted, management stays protected.

2. Admin Home Screen (Everything in One View)

When a Normal Admin logs in, they see one simple dashboard:

CVs waiting to be reviewed

CVs already processed today

Interviews scheduled

Messages needing replies

No settings. No system controls.
Just work items.

3. CV Inbox (Where All Work Starts)
Assigned CVs Only

Admins only see CVs assigned to them

No access to other Admins’ work

Clear CV Status

Each CV is clearly marked:

New

Under Review

Shortlisted

Rejected

Interviewed

Why this works:
No confusion, no overlap, no lost candidates.

4. CV Review (Fast & Guided)
AI Assistance (Simple, Not Technical)

Admins see:

Match score (Good / Average / Poor)

Key skills matched

Missing requirements (if any)

They don’t adjust AI rules — they use the guidance.

One-Click Decisions

Shortlist

Reject

Request more info

If rejected, Admin must select a reason from a list
(no free-text bias or risky wording).

5. Candidate Communication (Safe & Professional)
Message Templates

Pre-approved messages only

No custom risky wording

Admins can:

Invite for interview

Request documents

Send rejection messages

All messages are:

Logged

Time-stamped

Visible to Super Admin

6. Interview Handling (Straightforward)

Admins can:

Propose interview times

Confirm availability

Mark attendance

They cannot:

Override hiring stages

Skip required steps

This keeps the process clean and fair.

7. Document Handling (View, Not Control)

Admins can:

View uploaded documents

Check completeness

Admins cannot:

Download sensitive files

Export data

Share documents externally

This aligns directly with Super Admin security rules.

8. Daily Performance Visibility (No Pressure, Just Clarity)

Admins can see their own stats only:

CVs processed today

Average processing time

Interviews handled

They cannot see:

Other Admins’ performance

Financial usage

System analytics

Why this works:
Focus on work, not competition or politics.

9. System Rules (Admins Follow, Not Change)

Normal Admins:

Cannot create jobs

Cannot change hiring rules

Cannot adjust AI scoring

Cannot approve spending

Cannot export data

If something needs escalation:

They flag it

Super Admin decides

10. Audit & Accountability (Invisible but Always On)

Admins don’t see this — but it protects everyone.

The system records:

Logins

CV actions

Messages sent

Status changes

Admins are protected from false accusations
Management is protected from risk.

HOW NORMAL ADMIN & SUPER ADMIN WORK TOGETHER
Super Admin	Normal Admin
Controls access	Uses assigned access
Controls money	Uses allocated work
Sets rules	Follows rules
Sees everything	Sees own tasks
Exports data	Cannot export
Oversees risk	Executes safely

They do not overlap — and that’s the strength.

Why Bosses Like This Design

✔ Easy to train
✔ Hard to misuse
✔ Scales from 1 recruiter to 1,000
✔ No feature overload
✔ Clear separation of power













THE QUICKCV ENTERPRISE OPERATING DOCTRINE

A Simple, Governed System for High-Volume Hiring

INTRODUCTION

QuickCV exists to solve one problem only:

Large numbers of applicants create chaos if control is unclear.

Most recruitment systems focus on features.
QuickCV focuses on control, cost certainty, and accountability.

The system is designed so that:

Leadership stays in charge

Recruiters stay productive

Spending stays predictable

Data stays protected

Nothing else matters.

THE CORE PRINCIPLE

QuickCV is built on a single rule:

The people who spend money and carry legal responsibility must not be the same people who process CVs.

Everything in the system follows from this rule.

COMMERCIAL MODEL (CLEAR, PREDICTABLE, DEFENSIBLE)

QuickCV uses a pay-for-use intelligence model.

You do not pay for promises.
You do not pay per hire.
You pay for CVs processed.

Monthly CV Processing Costs
Monthly CV Volume	Cost per CV	Maximum Monthly Spend
0 – 1,000	R6.50	R6,500
1,001 – 10,000	R4.50	R45,000
10,001 – 50,000	R2.50	R125,000
50,000+	R1.00	R125,000 + R1 per extra CV

As volume increases, cost per CV decreases.
This rewards scale and discourages waste.

LICENSING STRUCTURE (NO SURPRISES)

QuickCV has only two license types:

Super Admin Portal
R14,500 per month
Covers oversight, reporting, compliance, and national control.

Normal Admin Seats
R2,500 per seat per month
Each seat equals one recruiter workspace, locked to one device.

There are no hidden fees.

SECURITY & DATA CONTROL (BUILT-IN, NOT OPTIONAL)

Security is not a feature — it is enforced by design.

One user, one device

Sessions cannot be shared

Access can be revoked instantly

All activity is recorded permanently

This protects:

Candidate data

Company reputation

Legal standing

OPERATIONAL FLOW (END-TO-END, SIMPLE)

QuickCV always runs in the same sequence:

Investment
Leadership licenses the system and allocates CV volume.

Launch
A hiring link is published.

Intake
Applications arrive centrally.

Distribution
Work is assigned to recruiters.

Execution
Recruiters process CVs using AI assistance.

Audit & Closure
Results are reviewed, exported if needed, and the campaign closes.

No steps are skipped.
No steps overlap.

CONTROL WITHOUT MICROMANAGEMENT

QuickCV is designed so leadership:

Sees everything

Interferes rarely

Acts only when needed

Recruiters:

Focus only on their assigned work

Move fast

Follow fixed rules

This creates speed without risk.

COMPLIANCE BY DEFAULT

All recruitment activity is:

Logged

Time-stamped

Traceable

This ensures alignment with:

POPIA

Internal governance policies

Audit and legal requirements

No extra configuration is required.

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BOTH SMALL AND LARGE ORGANISATIONS

For a small company:

One Super Admin

One recruiter

Full control from day one

For a multinational:

Central oversight

Distributed execution

Identical rules everywhere

The system scales without changing behavior.

THE QUICKCV POSITION

QuickCV is not an HR tool.
It is not an applicant tracker.
It is not a recruitment agency replacement.

It is a governed hiring system.

It exists to ensure that:

Money is controlled

Work is measurable

Data is protected

Decisions are defensible

FINAL STATEMENT

QuickCV turns hiring from a risk into a managed operation.

It allows organisations to process thousands or millions of applications while remaining:

In budget

In control

In compliance

That is the entire philosophy.
Nothing more. Nothing less.
